            <p>My journey to make my surrounding life warm and inviting started with my favorite content creator - Maisy Leigh. I have been following her for upwards of 2 years. Being part of her discord community has brought me lots of happiness! This picture of Maisy is with her collab she did with Gantri. I would love to own one of those lamps but they are VERY expensive!</p>

            <p>Inspirations for my current setup have been pulled from many different things that I have seen online. I have spent too many hours pining over desk setups on instagram and the various discord servers I am apart of. The picture above is of Maisy's desk.</p>

                  <li>Peg Board: having this gives me the freedom to be creative with my nick nacks. Sometimes I struggle with the balance of decorating it vs having room to keep it functional!</li>
                  <li>Monitor Riser: the monitor riser I really want is ~$250~ I wasn't able to find one to fit what I had in mind exactly - so I built my own!</li>
                  <li>Lighting: There are a lot of </li>
