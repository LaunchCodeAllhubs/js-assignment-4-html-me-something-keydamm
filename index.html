         <p>My journey to make my surrounding life warm and cozy started with my favorite content creator - Maisy
            Leigh. I have been following her for upwards of 2 years. Being apart of her discord community has brought me
            lots of joy and happiness! Maisy has a design studio that she runs with her family - together they did a lighting collaboration with Gantri. I would love to own one of
            those lamps but they are VERY expensive! <a href="https://www.gantri.com/cozyleigh">Click here</a> to check out the collab! </p>

         <p>Inspirations for my current setup have been pulled from many different things that I have seen online. I
            have spent too many hours pining over desk setups on instagram and the various discord servers I am apart
            of. The picture above is of Maisy's desk.</p>

         <p>My current desk setup brings me so much satisfaction. I'm constantly changing it up and moving things
            around but this is a glimpse of what it looks like! It hasn't always looked this way though. It's taken me a
            lot of time to perfect my space! Having such a beautiful setup makes me excited to sit down every day!</p>

         <ul>
            <li>Peg Board: having this gives me the freedom to be creative with my nick nacks. Sometimes I struggle with
               the balance of decorating it vs having room to keep it functional!</li>
            <li>Monitor Riser: the monitor riser I really want is ~$250~ I wasn't able to find one to fit what I had in
               mind exactly - so I built my own!</li>
            <li>Lighting: There are a lot of different thing at my desk that light up and provide some ambient lighting. The rabbit, cat, and toast all light up!</li>
            <li>Art: I have many different art pieces surrounding my desk. You can't see all of them in the photo. There are 5 Studio Ghibli prints and one Lord of the Rings print. See if you can spot them in my desk photo!</li>
            <li>Keyboards: I have found a great way to display my keyboards so I am able to rotate them in and out each day</li>

         <p>Here are some pictures of my desk setup at night. I love staying up late while working on things and feeling peaceful drinking some tea. I feel so zen with all of the surrounding lighting in my office!</p>

         <p>My two favorite keyboards are these two! The green one is the matcha keycap set. I got it as a valentines gift and fell in love with it! The neutral colored one is the dalgona keycap set. Both of the keycaps are from my favorite brand called Osume! To browse their website and see all of their wonderful items, <a href="https://osumekeys.com/">click here</a>!</p>

         <p>Speaking of the keycaps on those boards - these are drinks that I &#10084; to make! Matcha & Dalgona!! Sometimes I get fancy with my matcha and make it into a strawberry matcha!</p>

         <img class="img-lg float-left img-border-peach" src="/images/sitting-area.jpg" />
         <p>This is a nice seating area beside my desk where I like to sit and read. When this spot is not being used as an area for myself, it's used for friends and family. Sometimes they sit here while I work/game or I will set them up with a makeshift desk so they can work alongside me for the day and have a setup of their own!</p>

         <p>Everybody needs a nerd bookshelf, right? This is mine. It's filled with different things that I love. Using this allows me to put my nerdy self on display! </p>

         <img class="img-lg float-left img-border-green" src="/images/ghibli.jpg" />
         <p>Don't mind this area too much - it's the most recent development and it's still a work in progress. My mom and I found this credenza on sale and we painted it ourselves! It was blue before and now it's a sage green color. I'm still trying to figure out and decide what I will be putting on here. My vision was to eventaully get some more collector items from the animes that are displayed above. I loved these Studio Ghibli art prints from the moment I saw them!</p>

         <img class="img-lg float-right img-border-darkgreen" src="/images/record-player.JPG" />
         <p>Finally rounding out my office is my record player area! I love how this spot turned out. I actually used a "kallax" cubby from ikea and added the doors. It normally sits on the ground but I added some legs to it as well to give it some height. It makes me feel so warm & cozy when I have the lights like this.
